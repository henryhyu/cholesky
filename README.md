# Cholesky Solver for a Tree or General Graph

- Tree Plus Edges Problem (not dense enough, will stay sparse most of the time, wonâ€™t have dense sub matrices)
- Existing solvers are going to fail because they are dealing with denser problems
- Parallelizing Cholesky

use ```pip install numpy``` and ```pip install scipy```

### libraries:
http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html
http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/mmio-c.html

### I need to learn how to makefile
* Solver.c
	* reads given matrix, performs csparse's cs_cholsol()
	* to run: make; ./solve {file.mtx};
	
### TODO:
* more performance analysis?
* improve performance?
